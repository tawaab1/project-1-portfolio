This blog post is for Software Engineering 2019. It contains a Weekly Diary (summary) of what the team and I and what we did each week. It also contains an overview of what AGILE elements I used during each "sprint" of the software engineering assignment. 

Code evidence has also been uploaded to provide evidence of the work I have done on the back-end of the project.
