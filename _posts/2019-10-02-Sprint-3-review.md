## Goals

* Working with the constant changes that the client wants to see on the app.
* Focus on skills of researching about creating a database server for the app.

## AGILE implementation

### Principle 2

The client wanted to change one main function of the app (i.e the Dueling players, player versus player). The previous functionality users would connect together with two different devices to be able to 'duel' with each other. But the client wanted to change this function to having, two users using one device and having both users connect their beyblades to the same device aswell.

### Principle 4

Rather than having to waiting to meet with the client during the school period I was also able to grab the client during my study break for constant updates. The client also takes a long business trip from time to time, so to stay in constant contact I email/text the client whenever its appropriate.

### Messaging the client

## Reflection

### What I did well?
* To react well to major changes that the client wants
* Staying in constant contact with the client, even when either client or I are away.

### What I need to approve on?

* Researching about MySQL and its connection to React Native
* Staying in constant communication with fellow developers and supervisiors on where the project is upto at the moment


### What lesson did I learn?

* Reverting old changes back to allow the new important changes to take place first 

### What barriers did you encounter?

* Additional IMPORTANT features being introduced late in the project - creating a database
* Changing features ready to be implemented to a different feature.
