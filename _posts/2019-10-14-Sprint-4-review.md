## Goals

* Creating a database and connecting it to the app using React-Native

## AGILE implementation

###Principle 9
The focus of this sprint is to create a robust database that will be able to store player's information such as usernames, passwords, achievements, wins, losses, etc. With this feature implemented, I will be able to implement a login, creating a profile for a user and viewing a users profile and data associated with that user.

### This routes screens shows the app requesting data via the console and projecting on a web app

### This is the test database which will be used to test the login authentication

### Principle 1
I have shown the client an early development app which shows the Login, Solo, Duel and Profile screens to show the benefits of using a server database than being not.

## Reflection

### What I did well?
* Implementing a database although being a late introduced major issue

### What I need to approve on?

* Constant commits of project material to the repositiory.
* Writing up new issues that come up as the client requests new features to be implemented
* Updating the kanban board to suit the Sprints and updating the portfolio daily.

### What lesson did I learn?

* React-Native and MySQL implementations, learning about routes and sessions.

### What barriers did you encounter?

* Trying to tap into old knowledge about routes, sessions and databases.
* Implementing new major features and screens to the project to suit the customers request.
