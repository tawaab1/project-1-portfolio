## Week One
  This first week was mostly trying to get a feel for react-native. Issues did arise, I have been taking time trying to sort it out. I also have had my meeting with the client, gage with me to try and see what he wants done in the first sprint. Need to research further on how I can "port" Java code over to Java script.
