## Week One and Two

  This first week was mostly trying to get a feel for react-native. Issues did arise, I have been taking time trying to sort it out. I also have had my meeting with the client, gage with me to try and see what he wants done in the first sprint. Need to research further on how I can "port" Java code over to Java script. On the second week, I started to work on some wireframes so the client can see first hand how features we discussed are going to be presented on the app.

## Week Three and Four

  The 3rd week focuses on the the end of the Sprint 1, getting in touch with the client and letting him know about recent updates to the app. My aim this week was to let him what is and what is not possible to be done within the given time frame in terms of the development of the features. On the 4th week, my focus is switched to developing wireframes for the app and making a start of developing some front-end screens while constantly working on previous unfinished issues.

## Week Five and Six

  The 5th Week focuses on getting pages such as the intro pages ready for the client to see so they can review what has been happening so far. On Week 6, the client decided that he wanted a major feature implemented, and that was having a database being implemented as well so players can save their data such as usernames, passwords, etc.

## Week Seven and Eight

These 2 weeks focuses further on what the client wanted to see the past week which was having a database implemented. Additionally to creating a database, I also implemented an additional screen which was a login screen, and a create a user screen to help fetch and store data in the database.

## Week Nine and Ten

The 9th week I am working on improving the structure of the login screen, and further working on the local database to work with the login. The 10th week I had started reserching bluetooth packages that would help with connecting the device via the react native project.

## Week Eleven and Twelve

These two week I mainly focused on trying to finish implementation of the database User tables data so the login screen can fetch that data for authentication. I am also splitting focus on the bluetooth capabilities of the app, but I am unsure I will be able to complete it this sprint.

## Week Thirteen and Fourteen

These two weeks are dedicated to completing my portfolio of the project, and sorting out any final features that I need to implement into the project. I will also start thinking about my presentation of the project done so far.
