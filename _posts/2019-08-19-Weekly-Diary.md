## Week One and Two

  This first week was mostly trying to get a feel for react-native. Issues did arise, I have been taking time trying to sort it out. I also have had my meeting with the client, gage with me to try and see what he wants done in the first sprint. Need to research further on how I can "port" Java code over to Java script. On the second week, I started to work on some wireframes so the client can see first hand how features we discussed are going to be presented on the app.

## Week Three and Four

  The 3rd week focuses on the the end of the Sprint 1, getting in touch with the client and letting him know about recent updates to the app. My aim this week was to let him what is and what is not possible to be done within the given time frame in terms of the development of the features. On the 4th week, my focus is switched to developing wireframes for the app and making a start of developing some front-end screens while constantly working on previous unfinished issues.
