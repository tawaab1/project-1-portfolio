## Week One and Two
  This first week was mostly trying to get a feel for react-native. Issues did arise, I have been taking time trying to sort it out. I also have had my meeting with the client, gage with me to try and see what he wants done in the first sprint. Need to research further on how I can "port" Java code over to Java script. On the second week, I started to work on some wireframes so the client can see first hand how features we discussed are going to be presented on the app.
