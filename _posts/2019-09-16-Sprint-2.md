## Goals

* Get a concept of what the client and associates wants to see on the app.
* Start working on different views for the app

## AGILE implementation

### Principle 4

In this sprint I got to meet with the client's associates, where we brainstormed further on what are the main features they wanted to see on the app. We have been constantly meeting every Monday to deliberate over ideas for features for the app

### Principle 11

The importance of this sprint was organising myself to work on things the are considered IMPORTANT to the app than working on things that would be considered extras. So I have assigned labels to my issues, so I can tell which issues are important and which ones are not so important.

## Reflection

### What I did well?
* Managing my kanban and making different labels for each issue.
* Complete several tasks on this Sprint.

### What I need to approve on?

* Brushing up on my knowledge of React-Native
* Talk to other developers in the group to get ideas on how I should tackle problems
* Making my thoughts more clear to the client on how confident am I in tackling this project.


### What lesson did I learn?

* Conveying issues tactfully to the client; especially regarding ideas they may have come up with that could be considered out of the scope of the project.

### What barriers did you encounter?

* Time constrants - need to work on simplifying things, so I do not work on too much and get distracted from the important issues.
* My knowledge on React-native is very limited so it is a very big disadvantage for to dive into big features of the project without first knowing what I am doing.
