## Goals

The most important goal during this sprint was to touch base with my client for the first time and getting his perspective on how he wants the project to be run. Starting to work with react-native in terms of running the java app on it.

## AGILE implementation

### Principle 7

A primary objective was to able to get the BT-Blade app to run with react-native. Because there are no visible documentation on how this is going to be done, I will have to employ some method to be able to perform this. This may involve further researching and working on the app on a "playground"/test branch off the development branch side of things.

### Principle 4

The client and I have scheduled meetings twice a week, meeting on Mondays and Fridays during the lunch break for convenience to go over the "whats new?" with the development of the app. If neither the client or I can make it during these times, we can contact each other via email or through phone messaging to keep in contact about any updates on the app.

### Principle 5

Although everyone in the mobile app project group have different things that they are working on, we do take the time to come together as a group every monday and friday to keep in touch with one another and see where everyone is at on their various projects. These meeting are done before every class sessions on Mondays and Fridays.
