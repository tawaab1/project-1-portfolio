## Goals

* Implementation of Bluetooth technology
* Portfolio updating and review of existing features to test and see that they work with the client

## AGILE implementation

### Principle 3

Working on the Bluetooth feature on react native has taken a significant amount of time and requires more time to complete. In the meantime, I have shown the client what has worked so far, discussing with them the features that has been developed and what features are left to develop to have something working.

### Principle 8

Because of personal emergency issues that arose, I was not able to maintain a consistent pace of sustainable development and missed a few days that could have gone into researching and implementing the bluetooth feature even further.

### Principle 12 and 6

Being time constrained by emergency personal issues, I had made effort to contact the team leader on what has been happening with the overall
project and emailing him wih a debrief summary.

## Reflection

### What I did well?
* Testing and making sure existing features are not broken after introduction of new features

### What I need to approve on?

* Making sure that there is sustainable development stage and keeping a consistent pace on it
* Keeping constant communication with the rest of the mobile development team.
* Dedicating more time to developing the project.

### What lesson did I learn?

* Better forms of researching techniques when it comes to reseaching Bluetooth-react-native packages


### What barriers did you encounter?

* Implementing bluetooth react native features was a volatile process. Since the bluetooth react native packages are rare to come across and not well updated andor maintained it was very hard to implement it into the react native project without it breaking the project entirely.
